Example Repo Title
Hello world!!!!

Second change!

New version of this course (2020)
gitforeverybody.com
http://gitforeverybody.com/ is designed to help people learn Git (and more advanced Git) from scratch. It is a 3 hour premium course.

In this Git Essentials / Git for Everybody course, you'll learn everything I use in a daily work flow, including:

creating a new repo
adding ssh keys
branching
merging
rebasing
tagging
resolving merge/rebase conflicts
(it covers A LOT more than the Git & GitHub Crash Course teaches)
You can find Git Essentials on:
